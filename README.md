This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of Carolina, Chapel Hill

The repository contains:
*2 python notebooks covering basic topics in coding with Python 3 and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis
*1 python notebook that is a step by step guide on how to use code to focus on certain parts of the data set
*1 .cvs file that is a subset of the County Public Health data

The materials have been adapted from the lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library

The data comes from the County Public Health Data


The respository can be used to:
*Instruct individuals on how to use code to navigate a large data set
*Instruct individuals on how to use code to identify the components of a data set
*Instruct students or researchers on how to use code to answer research questions from those data sets
